        content: "My name is Ayanda Mkize and I grew up in Magabheni Township. I did my Internship through CATHSETA and was placed as an intern at a company called Bluff Eco Park. During my internship I acquired skills such as Telephone Etiquette, Customer Service, Business Administration and Communication. I studied Tourism Management and being a Front Desk Receptionist Intern in the Accommodation Sector really assisted me in understanding the basics of Accommodation and Bookings. I would like to see myself as a Hotel Manager in future. I learnt more about listening to clients to understand what they need during their stay. I also learnt a lot about different types of Online Booking Websites. The importance of portraying a professional image, smiling and being friendly to customers and understanding different languages was very important in the job. Being a team player and also working independently was also required and I was able to identify my strengths and weaknesses. This job also required creative thinking and problem solving. I would love to thank Insika Foundation and CATHSETA for the opportunity they gave me.",

I was selected to be an Intern through Insika Foundation at the Nongoma Municipality where my job included processing invoices, dealing with residential confirmations, filing, and assisting with walk in clients on a day-to-day basis.

I was selected to be an Intern in 2018 to 2019 and my host employer was Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife. During my internship at Mkhuze I was able to learn all the roles and responsibilities of a Receptionist like welcoming guest on arrival checking guests in and out when they depart. I was also able to be a switchboard operator and perform general office duties like filling, photocopying, printing and scanning.  Attending the curio shop and making financial transactions as a cashier and doing reservations was part of my job. One of the lessons that I learnt during my Internship is that persistence always pays off. It may not be when we want it to happen, but if we stay persistent day in and day out, we will eventually get to where we want to go. Do not seek for instant praise and gratification, be patient and trust the process. I would like to thank the Insika Foundation for the opportunity they gave us, they were able to help us with everything since the beginning of the journey especially Nontobeko Mnyandu whom we communicated with more often till the end of the Internship.",
